# ganeti-instance-debootstrap defaults file

# if you want to change from the default of installing debian stable
# on the next instance, customize this file before the instance
# installation

# PROXY: if non-null, use this as an http-proxy in order to speed up
# non-cached installs; not that if not set, debootstrap might still
# use a system-wide proxy setting if it is exported in the
# ganeti-noded daemon environment
# PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:3128/"

# MIRROR: do not customize MIRROR if you want to be able to install
# both debian and ubuntu, since they have different defaults; or
# customize it before each install
# MIRROR="http://ftp.debian.org/debian"

# ARCH: define ARCH only if you want a different architecture than the
# current one; the known use case is to install a 32-bit instance on a
# 64-bit node; choose either "i386" or "amd64":
# ARCH="i386"

# SUITE: change suite to any of the ones supported by deboostrap; this
# could be unstable, etch, etc.:
# SUITE="lenny"

# EXTRA_PKGS: depending on the suite and architecture you are using, different
# extra packages are needed for different hypervisors. For example:
#
# Xen, for etch/lenny i386:
# EXTRA_PKGS="linux-image-xen-686,libc6-xen"
# Xen, for etch/lenny amd64:
# EXTRA_PKGS="linux-image-xen-amd64"
# KVM, for lenny i386:
# EXTRA_PKGS="acpi-support-base,console-tools,udev,linux-image-686"
# KVM, for lenny amd64:
# EXTRA_PKGS="acpi-support-base,console-tools,udev,linux-image-amd64"
#

# CUSTOMIZE_DIR: a directory containing scripts to customize the installation.
# The scripts are executed using run-parts
# By default /etc/ganeti/instance-debootstrap.d
# CUSTOMIZE_DIR="/etc/ganeti/instance-debootstrap.d"

# GENERATE_CACHE: if set to yes (the default), create new cache files;
# any other value will disable the generation of cache files (but they
# will still be used if they exist)
GENERATE_CACHE="yes"

# CLEAN_CACHE: should be set to the number of days after which to
# clean the cache; the default is 14 (two weeks); to disable cache
# cleaning, set it to an empty value ("")
CLEAN_CACHE="14"

# PARTITION_STYLE: whether and how the target device should be partitioned.
# Allowed values:
# 'none': just format the device, but don't partition it
# 'msdos': install an msdos partition table on the device, with a single
#          partition on it
# (more styles may be added in the future)
# The default is "msdos" from ganeti 2.0 onwards, but none if installing under
# Ganeti 1.2 (os api version 5)
# PARTITION_STYLE="none"
