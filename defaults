# BOOT_SIZE=""

# FILESYSTEM: Set which filesystem to format the disks as. Currently only
# supports ext3 or ext4. Default is ext3.
# FILESYSTEM="ext3"

# KERNEL_ARGS: Add additional kernel boot arguments to an instance. This only

# KERNEL_ARGS=""

# IMAGE_NAME: Name of the image to use

# Examples include:
#   centos-5.4 debian-4.0 fedora-12

# IMAGE_DIR: directory location for disk images
# ( default is @localstatedir@/cache/ganeti-instance-image )
# IMAGE_DIR=""

# NOMOUNT: Do not try to mount volume (if it is not a linux partition). Accepts
# either 'yes' or 'no'. This option is useful for installing Windows images for

# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts
# IMAGE_DEBUG=0

# IMAGE_URL: a remote (HTTP) location for the images.
